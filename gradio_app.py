## Database Schema

### Tables:
- **employees**: id, name, salary, department_id, city, age, join_date, position, email
- **departments**: id, name, location, budget  
- **projects**: id, title, budget, department_id, start_date, end_date, status

### Supported Operations:
- **SELECT**: Show, list, display, get
- **INSERT**: Insert, add, create
- **UPDATE**: Update, modify, change
- **DELETE**: Delete, remove
- **AGGREGATE**: Average, sum, count, total

### New Natural Language Patterns:

#### Age Filters:
- "Show employees older than 30"
- "Show employees younger than 25"
- "Show employees with age between 25 and 40"

#### City Filters:
- "Show employees in New York"
- "Show employees in London"
- "Show employees in Tokyo"

#### Join Date Filters:
- "Show employees who joined after 2020-01-01"
- "Show employees who joined before 2019-12-31"
- "Show employees who joined in 2021"

#### Position Filters:
- "Show employees with position Software Engineer"
- "Show employees with title Manager"

#### Complex Combinations:
- "Show employees in New York who are older than 25 and earn more than 50000"
- "Insert a new employee named Alice with salary 55000, age 28, from London, as Software Engineer"

### Examples:
- "Show all employees"
- "List employees in engineering department"
- "What is the average salary?"
- "Insert a new employee named John with salary 60000"
- "Update salary to 75000 for employees in marketing"
- "Show employees older than 30"
- "Show employees in New York"
- "Show employees who joined after 2020-01-01"
